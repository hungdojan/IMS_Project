# Outline for the simulation study (subject of fungi)
## General points
- Is the published thesis valid? What are the limitations of the model, how did our stduy improve/reflect this?
- **Initial hypothesis**
  - As nurtrients are depleted, the fungal colony grows sparser, but with the same "diameter". We can observe fractal growth
  - How complex is our model?
  - What was included in our model to reflect the inital hypothesis? What was excluded?
  - What are the results of our implementation?
  - How was reality discretized into a cellular automaton?
